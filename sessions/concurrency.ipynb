Therefore, the main benefit from threading is that one waiting job (I/O, sleep, waiting for user event) doesn't block other jobs from running. Or as the saying goes, threads are good for doing nothing: waiting mostly.\n",

    "# Coroutines\n",
    "\n",
    "**coroutines** are functions that can be suspended and resumed, similar to generators. When doing I/O bounded async programming, coroutines can also become `Future` objects. You can think about them as lightweight threads or green threads: they are scheduled by Python, rather than the operating system, and run in the same thread and process - so not useful for CPU-bounded programs even if releasing the GIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coroutines are defined using `async def` (or in Python 3.4, using `def` with a special decorator). \n",
    "\n",
    "Coroutines can yield the control using the `await` statement (or `yield from` in Python < 3.5) to other coroutines, which lets the scheduler know that this coroutines in now waiting for results from another coroutine. The scheduler then schedules the other coroutine to run. This is in contrast to theads, in which control switches are managed by the operating system (and sometimes prevented by the GIL), which requires us (sometimes) to use locks and semaphors in order to make sure that our data stays \"whole\", and creates risks like GIL wars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Async programming with coroutines can enchance runtime in I/O-bouded programs, and the programmatic overhead is relatively small (as can be seen below). Moreover, coroutines are much cheaper than threads, in terms of their memory footprint, as they all live in a single interperter and thread. Therefore, we can spawn thousands of them, while we cannot afford to spawn thousands of threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an implementation of the above `most_common_word` program using async programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "- we define the coroutine, which uses the [aiohttp](http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package to read files from the web instead of the *urllib* package\n",
    "- *aiohttp* does async HTTP requests and responses (both for servers and clients)\n",
    "- we instantiate the coroutines (much like we would do with generators, rather than functions)\n",
    "- we create an event loop, using the standard library module [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html), which will be responsible for scheduling and driving the coroutines, and handling the switching of control between them\n",
    "- give the loop all the coroutines\n",
    "- run the loop.\n",
    "- collect the async results\n",
    "- print the results\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: to install *aiohttp*, use `pip install aiohttp` (if you are following this notebook on *Binder* and the next import doesn't work, try running this in a cell: `!/home/main/anaconda2/envs/binder/bin/python -m pip install aiohttp`)."
